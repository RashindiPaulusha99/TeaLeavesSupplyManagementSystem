# *Introduction* 📝
A wholesale distributor distributes goods for their retail clients(customer). The company has a huge stock and
it is maintained by a storekeeper. Retail customers make their orders from the cashier and the cashier sends
customer orders for the stores. Stores can prepare orders within a few hours. The cashier of the company is 
responsible for creating the final bill for the customer and the customer needs to pay the amount in full (all 
other payment options are disabled). Discounts are available for items. For management purposes, few 
reports have been introduced such as daily, monthly and annually sales statics and popular goods in different 
seasons. Seasonal trends are most important for the company when the new supplier orders made.

wholesale distributor company wants to do that process quickly by software application. Therefore this project is the standalone application created to demonstrate this process using Layered Architecture and connecting Database to store data.
