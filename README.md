# *Introduction* 📝
There are many variations in the existing manual methodology for processing, managing and 
storing data in the process, from transporting tea leaves harvested from tea estates to storing 
them in tea factories. There are a number of hurdles in calculating data obtained from measuring 
tea leaves in factories. Also, the accuracy of the data obtained from that calculation is minimal.

There are also a number of issues with setting up payments for supplier leaves. That is, in the 
manual methodology that has taken place so far, the time taken for it increases, the accuracy of 
the data decreases, and the difficulty in storing and managing the data increases. There are also a 
number of issues with bill preparation. Figure 1.2 illustrates this manual methodology.
 
Therefore, my hope is that this proposed project will facilitate data input to factory users, speed 
up and compute calculations, and streamline data storage, management and data retrieval. My 
proposed project also seeks to expedite the calculation of payments to suppliers, facilitate the 
systematic maintenance of revenue records and storage records, print accurate bills for suppliers, 
provide a better user interface, and expedite the entire user process.
